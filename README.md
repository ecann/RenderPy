# RenderPy
A software renderer written from scratch in Python 3, using only modules from the Python Standard Library.

## To Run
```python 
python3 render.py
```
## Modules
### Image.py
Contains an image class capable of generating an image and exporting it to a PNG. Images are implemented as a buffer of 32-bit RGBA pixel color data stored in a byte array. This modules uses `zlib` and `struct` for compressing and packing PNG data. 

### Shape.py
Classes representing points, lines and triangles. Each has a `draw()` method for drawing that shape in an Image. Anti-aliased lines are drawn using [Wu's Line Drawing Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolin_Wu's_line_algorithm). Triangles are drawn by iterating over a bounding box and calculating barycentric coordinates to smoothly interpolate color over the shape.

### Model.py
Class with functions for reading a `.obj` file into a stored model, retrieving vertices, faces, properties of the model.

### Render.py
Implements the rendering pipeline. Loads a model, transforms vertices, computes shading, rasterizes faces into triangles, and outputs the final image to a PNG.
